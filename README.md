## Season Calendar

- In this section you can see the calendar for the selected season.

- With a tap on the event you can see the date, times of each session and the track map (it may not be available for all tracks from previous years).

- If the race has already been completed by clicking on the "View Results" button you can see the results of the race (currently only available for the main race).
