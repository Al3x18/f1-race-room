A Flutter project to have information on the F1 calendar, driver and team rankings and GP results at your fingertips.

## About the App

<strong>The application has four main screens.</strong>

- Season Calendar
- Driver Standings
- Team Standings

<strong>In each section at the top right you can open a screen to select the season (from 2008 to the current season).</strong>

With a tap on the event you can see the date, times of each session and the track map (it may not be available for all tracks from previous years).
